Predicting the burned area of forest fires with ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ANN):

Black Box Technique for prediction. Building a model, adding dense layers by defining desired number of neurons, using Activation Functions such as linear, relu, gaussian, softmax, etc. 
Training and testing the model in both R and Python. 

Packages used in R: neuralnet or nnet. 
Packages used in Python: keras, sklearn.
